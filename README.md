# ⚠️ Account Notice

Hey there! 👋

This GitHub account is **no longer maintained**.

Due to an unfortunate loss of access to two-factor authentication, I’ve had to start fresh with a new GitHub profile.

👉 **Please visit my new GitHub account here: [@Hari-Sri-Shanmukha-Sai](https://github.com/Hari-Sri-Shanmukha-Sai)**  
That’s where you’ll find all my latest projects, updates, and contributions.

### 📦 What's Happening to This Account?

- I’m unable to manage or update this account anymore due to lost 2FA access.
- All new work has moved to the new account linked above.
- Existing public projects may remain here as archived references, but they won’t be updated.

### 🙏 Thank You!

If you came here from a resume, previous collaboration, or old repo link — thanks for checking in!  
I’m still very much active and building — just at a new GitHub home now. Feel free to connect with me there.
